# SwiftHelloGtk
A simple 'hello-world' app using SwiftGtk

## Troubleshooting
Here are some common errors you might encounter and how to fix them.

### Old Swift toolchain or Xcode
If you get an error such as

	$ ./build.sh 
	error: unable to invoke subcommand: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/swift-package (No such file or directory)
	
this probably means that your Swift toolchain is too old.  Make sure the latest toolchain (Swift 3 preview 3 at the time of this writing) is the one that is found when you run the Swift compiler, e.g.:

	$ swiftc --version
	Apple Swift version 3.0 (swiftlang-800.0.34.6 clang-800.0.33)
	Target: x86_64-apple-macosx10.9

  If you get an older version, make sure that the right version of the swift compiler is found first in your `PATH`.  On macOS, use xcode-select to select and install the latest version, e.g.:

	sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Devel/Xcode-beta.app
	xcode-select --install
